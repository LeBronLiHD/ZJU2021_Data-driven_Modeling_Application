	abstract = {Background The clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age at onset, disease duration, rate of progression, and constellation of motor versus nonmotor features. Due to these variable presentations, counseling of patients about their individual risks and prognosis is limited. There is an unmet need for predictive tests that facilitate early detection and characterization of distinct disease subtypes as well as improved, individualized predictions of the disease course. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to address this critical need.Methods and Findings We used unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches for subtype identification and prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) (n=328 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) (n=112 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate and fast disease progressors. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression four years after initial diagnosis with an average Area Under the Curve of 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.96 {\textpm} 0.01 for PDvec1, 0.87 {\textpm} 0.03 for PDvec2, and 0.96 {\textpm} 0.02 for PDvec3). We have demonstrated robust replication of these findings in the independent validation cohort.Conclusions These data-driven results enable clinicians to deconstruct the heterogeneity within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for clinical trials by improving the detection of significant clinical outcomes that might have been masked by cohort heterogeneity. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, clinical trial design, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.},
